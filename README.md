This is (currently) more or less a port of parts of the wonderful "Raytracing
in one weekend" book, though we'll see how much more I get through. I wanted
to learn a bit of Mojo as well as try out some other ideas so perhaps they'll
make it on here at some point.

The book can be followed along at: https://raytracing.github.io/

The book is licensed under CC0-1.0 license. This repo is (currently) licensed
the same way.
